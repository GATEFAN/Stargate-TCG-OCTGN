Stargate-TCG
============

An OCTGN3 game definition for the Stargate Trading Card Game.

This project is currently a work-in-progress and as such, many cards will not work correctly.  The development code has been made available here to track its progress, but until the game is playable the commits will not follow any logical flow or patterns.

Since gameplay is still in debug/testing mode, several in-game functions are in place to shortcut game rules.  The two playable decks come pre-loaded when you start or reset a game.  Cards can be manually stopped, assigned, blocked, destroyed (etc etc) which override game rules.

You are welcome to clone the repo and try the project out at any time.  The data is uploaded in corresponding folders, you will have to compile the proper o8g and o8c format to install them in OCTGN. Documentation on how to use the game definition is NOT a priority at this time and will not be available during development.
